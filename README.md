# NeoDialog
NeoDialog is a module that handles dialog for you! No need to manually write those for loops going through every letter in your text to get that typewrite effect anymore, just use this module to easily create & run dialogs!

# Why even bother using it?
It's very easy to create dialog trees and then run them with your gui! It's made to be compatible with any dialog Gui, so as long as you have a ScreenGui with a TextLabel for the dialog's text somewhere inside it, you can use it with no problems!

# Features
- It's strictly-typed
- Easily modifyable
- You can specify the name of the characters who are talking
- The module comes with [Crygen's TextModule](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/v3-huge-update-textmodule-handle-every-text-features-easily/2200604) (doesn't utilize their typewrite though) so it's easier to format rich text in dialogs
